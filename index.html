## Statement of Purpose

I am Katumbi Karhashubwa Georges, a Master of Science in Information Technology (Research Track) student at Carnegie Mellon University Africa, focusing on network telemetry and observability in distributed systems. I am applying for the Max Planck Institute Summer Internship in Network and Operating Systems (June–September 2026) to deepen my systems research and prepare for a PhD.

### Highlights
- **Research focus**: Distributed systems performance, network telemetry/monitoring, OS security, and resource management.
- **Hands-on systems experience**: Completed Linux From Scratch 11.0 (custom kernel 5.13.12, GCC 11.2.0, binutils, 90+ packages), building automated multi-phase toolchains and GRUB boot workflows.
- **Current research**: Research Intern at CMU CyLab with Prof. Vyas Sekar and Milind Srivastava, integrating Circa (sketch-based telemetry) with Prometheus/Elasticsearch on MOSIP to evaluate cost–accuracy tradeoffs (entropy, heavy hitters, cardinality).
- **Broader systems work**: Real-time age/gender detection web app (OpenCV DNN + Flask); TA for Linux administration (security hardening, firewalls, IDS, secure protocols); prior internships in threat intelligence and incident response (incl. Log4Shell CVE-2021-44228).
- **Programming**: C, Python, Bash; network infrastructure and observability stacks.

I’m excited about contributing to Max Planck’s work at the intersection of networking and operating systems and learning from leading researchers in a collaborative environment.
