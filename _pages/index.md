# About

I'm a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University Africa researching network telemetry and observability in distributed systems. I work at CMU's CyLab evaluating sketch-based monitoring solutions that make large-scale infrastructure more efficient.

I'm passionate about understanding how systems work at the lowest levelâ€”from building a Linux distribution from scratch to deploying production monitoring systems. My goal is to make distributed systems more observable and efficient through better algorithms and OS-level optimizations.

## What I'm Working On

### Network Telemetry Research at CMU CyLab
I'm evaluating Circa, a sketch-based telemetry system, to reduce monitoring costs in distributed systems. This involves integrating approximation algorithms into production observability stacks and measuring the tradeoffs between accuracy and efficiency.
