# About

I am a Master's student in Information Technology (Research Track) at Carnegie Mellon University Africa, with a strong focus on **AI Safety and Alignment** under the supervision of Prof. Prasenjit Mitra. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, cybersecurity, and system architecture, with a deep commitment to developing rigorous evaluation methods and alignment techniques for autonomous systems.

Currently, I work as a Research Intern at CyLab, Carnegie Mellon University, where I evaluate sketch-based telemetry systems for production deployment on network testbeds, focusing on approximation algorithms to reduce monitoring costs while maintaining accuracy. My work involves integrating novel observability solutions into large-scale distributed systems infrastructure.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's in Information Technology with a concentration in Networks and Communication Systems from Adventist University of Central Africa, where I served as a Teaching Assistant for Linux & Network Administration. I've also gained practical experience through virtual internships with AIG and Mastercard, focusing on cybersecurity analysis, threat intelligence, and security awareness training.

Beyond research, I enjoy teaching and have instructed over 60 students in Computer Science at the IGCSE level. I'm passionate about making technology education accessible and am committed to contributing to AI safety research that addresses real-world challenges.

I'm actively seeking research internship opportunities for Summer 2026 to advance my work in AI alignment and safety.
