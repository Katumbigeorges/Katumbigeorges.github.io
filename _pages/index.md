# About

I am a Staff Scientist at [[C]Worthy](https://www.cworthy.org/). At [C]Worthy we are building software that supports multi-scale oceanographic modeling and data integration for quantifying the efficacy and ecological impacts of ocean-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR). My work involves using ocean models like Oceananigans to explore how ocean circulation affects CDR. Additionally, I develop software and machine learning tools to enhance the computational efficiency and reproducibility of ocean biogeochemical model simulations.

Before joining [C]Worthy, I worked with the [M2LInES Team](https://m2lines.github.io/) and the [Ocean Transport and Eddy Energy Climate Process Team (CPT)](https://ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io/). 
My research with the CPT was focused on better understanding the ocean eddy energy cycle and improving mesoscale eddy parameterizations by making them energetically consistent.
As part of the M2LInES project, I investigated the development of eddy parameterizations using machine learning techniques, and explored the integration of ML-based eddy parameterizations with a physical dynamical core to create hybrid climate models.
I have also worked on adjoint modeling and ocean state estimation within the [ECCO project](https://ecco-group.org/). Within the ECCO framework, I applied techniques from the computational sciences in order to quantify uncertainties in ocean state estimates and gain new insights into how to improve the global ocean observing system. 

I am engaged in developing open-source Python tools to enable our community to perform efficient, reproducible, and open science. 
I am a PI in the [DJ4Earth project](https://dj4earth.github.io/), where we develop and use an open-source framework for universal differentiable programming in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), which integrates Bayesian inverse methods with scientific machine learning in Earth system models.

When I'm not doing research, I like being active in the outdoors. I love rock climbing, trail running, and backcountry skiing.
