## What I'm Currently Working On

### Sketch-Based Telemetry for Network Monitoring

**Research Intern — CyLab**  
*Sep 2024 – Present*  
Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA  
*Supervisors: Prof. Vyas Sekar and Milind Srivastava (PhD Candidate)*  
*Remote from Kigali, Rwanda*

I am currently evaluating **Circa**, a sketch-based telemetry system, for production deployment on the CyLab-Africa/Upanzi network testbed. This research focuses on reducing telemetry costs in distributed systems through approximation algorithms while maintaining monitoring accuracy.

**Key Research Activities:**
- **System Integration:** Integrating Circa into existing observability stacks (Prometheus and Elasticsearch) on MOSIP infrastructure to validate approximation-first network monitoring approaches
- **Experimental Design:** Designing and executing experimental protocols to benchmark sketch-based telemetry performance against traditional exact collection methods
- **Data Analysis:** Collecting and analyzing distributed network monitoring metrics to quantify cost-accuracy tradeoffs of sketch primitives (entropy estimation, heavy hitter detection, and cardinality estimation)
- **Production Development:** Contributing to development of production-ready observability solutions for large-scale distributed systems using sketch approximation algorithms

This work represents a novel approach to network monitoring that balances computational efficiency with monitoring accuracy, with potential applications in large-scale distributed systems and cloud infrastructure.
